# CryptoPredictor
CryptoPredictor is a program used to predict the price of various cryptocurrencies. I made this for a school project, and it is mostly proof of concept. I have not tested its accuracy yet. It takes in a .tmp file of Poloniex data and outputs a simple number that denotes whether the program thinks the currency will go up or down.
